# Spiffy
A single page, responsive portfolio template.

This project was developed from scratch, without the use of a tutorial or a template.  I certainly learned a lot through it.
I know the code is not as clean as it needs to be.  For instance, I know now that I should have used a responsive grid (columns)
or a clearfix class to better maintain the structure of the theme.  This most likely would have allowed me to use far less 
media queries than I actually ended up using.  Overall, however, I think it looks really good for a rookie developer.  I will
just have to take what I've learned from this project and make sure I incorporate those things into my following projects.

The more you code, the more you learn.
